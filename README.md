# Unshelved Elves NFT Project

This project includes 20,000 Unshelved Elf NFTs: generative images built using a Python script to assemble a variety of backgrounds, traits and characteristics. The project is built for deployment to the Polygon blockchain, and subsequent series of Unshelved Elves are planned with more locations and traits to increase variance and rarity.
